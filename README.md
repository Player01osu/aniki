# Aniki

Watch and keep track of anime.

## Quickstart

Requirements:
- SDL2 >= 2.0.14
- Cargo

You might also want to change where it looks for anime in [src/main](src/main).
Once a config file is developed, this won't be necessary.

```console
cargo b --release
```
```console
./target/release/aniki
```
